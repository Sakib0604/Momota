While the icky side effects of pregnancy may be starting to abate, your anxiety about having a healthy baby might be increasing. Your cravings may run the gamut from cheeseburgers to chalk (really!). Weird nonfood cravings are known as pica and can reflect a deficiency in your diet. This week, nearly all of the fetus's organs are beginning to function, and genitals begin to take on male or female form. Your uterus has begun to expand outside the protective pelvic bones. It will increase in size by almost 1,000 times by the end of your pregnancy! You may really be starting to show now, especially if it's not your first baby."/>

They strengthen your pelvic-floor muscles, helping with incontinence while preparing your body for delivery. If you will be 35 or older when you deliver, make an appointment to discuss genetic screening or diagnostic tests, such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS). They look for certain birth defects and are usually done between 10 and 12 weeks. Your doctor's office may provide counseling; if not, ask for a referral to a genetic counselor.Call your doctor if you're experiencing pica.Make an appointment if you're having the nuchal translucency test, which screens for Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities. The test must be done between 11 and 14 weeks.From now on, steer clear of any activities that pose the risk of a fall or abdominal trauma, such as horseback riding. Also avoid exercises that require you to lie flat on your backâ€”your growing fetus can place too much weight on a major vein, causing reduced blood flow to the uterus." />
