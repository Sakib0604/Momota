The embryo doubles in size but is still less than a half-inch long. As your pregnancy hormones increase, morning sickness may be worsening. Or, you may be ravenous 24/7. Your doctor may look or listen for the baby's heartbeat with an ultrasound. Once you see or hear it, your miscarriage risk drops to about 2 percent.

Most caregivers want to see you for the first time between six and 10 weeks.Reassure yourself that aside from extreme behaviors, such as using drugs, there's nothing you can do to cause a miscarriage. Yet, some research links early pregnancy losses to consuming more than 300 milligrams of caffeine daily, so to be safe, limit your intake.Think about when you want to tell family, friends and your boss you're pregnant. Some women wait until after the first trimester, when miscarriage risk drops.If you're nauseated, try eating several small meals throughout the day, especially ones with ginger and citrus; avoid strong odors; and wear acupressure wristbands.Try not to overdo it on the chow: Weight gain should be minimal in the first trimester. But don't feel guilty if you give in to an occasional craving.Though your due date sounds very far away, start reading up on baby care now. You won't have time after your newborn arrives."/>.
