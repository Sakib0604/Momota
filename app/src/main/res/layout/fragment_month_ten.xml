Your pregnancy is considered full-term now, and the lanugo—the downy hair that covered your baby's body—is starting to disappear. If you're still working, don't beat yourself up if you decide to go on leave a little earlier than you planned. If you haven't delivered yet, your OB will monitor you more closely. Some docs will allow women to go two weeks past their due date; most will induce by then."/>

Near-term babies have a higher risk of breathing difficulties and other complications.If you'll be returning to work after maternity leave and plan to breastfeed, find or create a suitable place to pump. (That does not mean a toilet stall!)Create a daily updated status sheet of all your tasks in case you go into labor and need to leave work suddenly.Pack your bag. The hospital will supply you with basic toiletries and gowns, but don't forget these essentials: lip balm and hard candies to wet your whistle during labor; a hair band; tennis balls in a tube sock for your partner to rub on your back.Call your doctor or head to the hospital when your contractions occur every five to 10 minutes or if your water breaks. Relax. Read a good breastfeeding book. Sleep. Relish these last days of feeling that little being moving and grooving inside your body. You can't believe how much you'll miss it."/>
